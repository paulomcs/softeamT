# 1. Add an enumeration for days of the week in `Class.py`
Days of the week is a flag integer. Each bit represents a day of the week,
starting with Sunday. The first bit is unused.

### Ex:
For a class that is mondays and fridays, the flag should be
```
00100010 = 34
```

# 2. Implement `__init__` method in each of the models in `src/lib/models`
Use best practices

# 3. Implement interfaces in each of the models in `src/lib/models`
These should be needed to create SQL queries
